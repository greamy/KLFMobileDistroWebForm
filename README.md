This is a senior design project completed at Western Michigan University, for a local food bank - Kalamazoo Loaves and Fishes.

The client requested a system to digitally collect data previously collected with paper forms. The system allows admins to generate QR codes for each of their distribution locations. When an end-user scans one of these QR codes they are sent to a web form, which asks for the necessary information. Once submitted, the data is stored in a SQL database, and can be exported as Excel files by an admin at any point. Additionally, admins are given the ability to clean the database, change admin login info, and modify distribution locations.
